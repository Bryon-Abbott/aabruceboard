<img src="images-v2/AA0100-Home.jpg" alt="images-v2/AA0100-Home.jpg" width="400"/>
<h3 id="11-sign-in">1.1 Sign In</h3>
<p>By Pressing the +Player icon on the [Home] page, players can sign in to their account.</p>
<p>To assist the player with entering the correct password, the [Eye] icon can be pressed to reveal the password.</p>
<p>If the user has forgotten their password, they can request a Password Reset by pressing the [Reset Password] button. This will send an email to the provided email address where they will be able to set a new password.</p>
<img src="images-v2/AA0101-SignIn.jpg" alt="images-v2/AA0101-SignIn.jpg" width="400"/>
<h3 id="12-sign-up">1.2 Sign Up</h3>
<p>If the player does not already have a Player Account, they need to sign up for one by pressing the [Sign Up] button at the right of the App Bar.</p>
<p>When setting up a new Player Account a valid email address must be provided.</p>
<p>The passwords must be at least 6 charachters long.</p>
<p>The password must be entered the same twice to ensure the user has entered the password correctly.</p>
<p>The initials are automatically provided when the players [First Name] and [Last Name] are entered. This can be changed but should be kept short as this is used to indicate Squares assigned to the player.</p>
<p>Scroll down if needed to press the [Sign Up] button.</p>
<p>When the Player inforamtion is entered successfully, an email will be sent to the provided email address allowing the player to verify their email account.</p>
<img src="images-v2/AA0102-SignUp.jpg" alt="images-v2/AA0101-SignIn.jpg" width="400"/>
<h3 id="13-update-profile">1.3 Update Profile</h3>
<p>Once the player account is created, the Player can update their profile information (First Name, Last Name, etc) via the [Update Profile] menu option from the [Home] screen.
From here the user can also see a summary of their Membership, Communities and Series.</p>
<p>All fields are required with the Display Name and Initials defaulting from the First Name and Last Name. These can be over written if desired.</p>
<h4 id="131-email-verification">1.3.1 Email Verification</h4>
<p>Players should only use valid emails as their Player ID to enable the full functionality of the BruceBoard App.</p>
<p>An verification email is set to the player when the account is first setup. If this is lost or unsuccessful, the player can initiate a new verificadtion email by pressing the [Verify Email] button.</p>
<p>Players can use the application without verifying their email but are not allowed to Request to Join any communities without verifying their email.</p>
<p>Owners can add non-verified Players to their communities but should be aware that the user may not have a valid email address.</p>
<p>If the Player's email has been verified, the [Verify Email] button will be disabled.</p>
<h4 id="132-delete-account">1.3.2 Delete Account</h4>
<p>Players can delete their account if desired. This will remove the Account from Firebase and the player will no longer have access to the Communities and/or Pools they are running.</p>
<p>The Player sign back up again but a new account will be provided and the Payer will need to re-request access to any communities they wish to join.  In addition, any communities or boards that they had will no longer be accessible.</p>
<img src="images-v2/AA0103-UpdateProfile.jpg" alt="AA0103-UpdateProfile" width="400"/>
<h3 id="14-my-communities">1.4 My Communities</h3>
<p>At the top of the [Home] page there are two tabs that allow the Player to view Pools accessed through 1. [My Communities] and 2. [Public Pools].</p>
<p>The Community Pools are organized by the Memberships that the Player has within different communities.</p>
<p>Communities are owner by Players and are given access to one or more of the owner's Groups that in turn, contain 1 or more Pools. Multiple Communities can access a single Group thus allowing a Player to have multiple Memberships with access to a Group and associated Pools.</p>
<p>The Player requests/receives credits for each membership which is displyed on the [Home] page beside the Membership ID.</p>
<p>On the [Home] page, the Groups that are accessible to each Membership the Player has are displayed on the page. Within each Group, the first couple of active Pools are displayed along with the number of active pools. The displayed Pools provide an indication of how many squares have been selected for the pools through the pie chart on the Pool card.</p>
<p>The Player can see all the active and complete pools within the Group by clicking on the [Double Chevron] icon for the Group.  This also allows users to access the Pool to select squares providing they have credits on their Membership</p>
<p>If the Player has a number of Memberships, they can scroll down the page to view them.</p>

<p>The Pool Board Page shows the Pool with the Away team across the top and the Home team down the side.</p>
<p>When a square is available, it will have the Initials &quot;FS&quot; indicating it is a Free Square. The user can select any Free Square to request it.</p>
<p>Once a Square is Taken, the Players Initials will be displayed in the Square and it will be disabled.</p>

<p>When the Owner of the Pool enteres the quarterly scores, the winning square for each quarter is highlighted red, lighter to darker for each quarter.</p>

<img src="images-v2/AA0302-Community-Members.png" alt="AA0302-Community-Members" width="400"/>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Add &quot;Excluded Player&quot; (1000) to the Community to be used to Exclude squares from a Pool. This is used when a full board isn't filled and the Owner wishes to exclude the unselected squares. These squares will not be included in the Total Credits for the Pool and will impact the number of Credits distributed from the Pool.</p>
